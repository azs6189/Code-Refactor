# Code-Refactor

Being able to consolidate CSS selectors allows the code to look neater and makes items easier to navigate.


Consolidated any paragraph within class=benefits styles (margin-bottom and font color).

These are the paragraphs in the column to the right of the page.



Consolidated the H3 for margin, color, and alignment. 

These are the titles in the column to the right of the page.



Consolidated any image within class=benefits styles (display, margin, and max-width).

These are the images or logos in the column to the right of the page.
